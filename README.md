# About this Repo
This repo covers analysis of wind directions at Westchester County Airport (HPN) and the direction of wind relative to the main runway 16-34. The main Jupyter notebook in this repo has all the code necessary to download the raw data and perform the analysis highlighted in the summary PDF. Copies of the data used are also included in the /data folder.

# Executive Summary
* Raw ASOS wind data was analyzed for HPN from 2006-2019. Wind direction is the primary factor in determining runway use. Analysis in this pack looks at 464,689 wind recordings across a 14 year period.

* Data shows a clear increase of 16-favoring winds during the last several years relative to earlier periods. Every year from 2011 onwards saw more 16-favoring winds than 2006-10. 2013-18 saw a further uptick in 16-favoring winds (the period of the recent HMMH study)

* Wind data also shows clear seasonality both during time of day and month of year. Observed seasonality impacts generally drive more traffic to use runway 16 during periods when sensitivity to aircraft noise is at its highest (afternoon daylight hours during the warmer months of the year when people are spending time outdoors). 

* The observed increases in 16-favoring winds are in line with the overall increase in traffic on the 16 approach reported by the HMMH study: 
  - ASOS data from 2013 - 2018 shows a 21% increase in 16-favoring winds
  - HMMH study reported a 24% increase in ‘day’ 16 traffic and a 18% increase in ‘night’ traffic for 16 over the same period
Localized cyclic weather patterns can cause dramatic shifts in winds that in turn would likely result in dramatic shifts in runway use. For example, the transition from winter to summer in 2016 saw a 174% increase in 16-favoring winds over just a few months.

* Significant empirical evidence would support the following logical conclusions from the 14 years worth of detailed wind data: 
  - Atmospheric patterns have shifted over recent years to cause a consistent increase in the occurrence of 16-favoring winds. It is unclear if this pattern is part of a broader cycle or represents a more permanent shift.
  - This clear and sustained shift in wind is likely the primary cause for the observed increases in arriving air traffic using runway 16 over the last several years
